        Our buisness is dedicated to spreading awareness about global warming and the abundant amount of trash in the
        world. Trash <br />
        polution is a big problem, and many people either don’t know what to do about it, or don’t try to make an
        impact. Our solution<br />
        to this world wide problem is a video game called Clean Planet. It teaches people about the negative effects of
        trash pollution<br />
        through a fun trash-pickup game. It also spreads awareness and motivates people to help their community protect
        the environment.<br />
        Ages range 7-20, but ages 40 do like to play it sometimes to kill time. </p>

            <p>Not everyone is aware of the global warming problem, and thankfully, our company noticed this.<br/>
       Global warming is an effect from humans. We burn fossil fuels, throw trash, and don't recycle, which heats up the earth. <br/>
    The earth is getting warmer each year, and we know it. Our buisness is doing everything it can to make the world a better place.</p>
